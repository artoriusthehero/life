Proven concepts:

Comedy{
	borne with man;
}

Society{
	social construct;
}

Is society alive? No. Can it tell me what's funny? No. ON TOP OF THAT, society doesn't even have a definition for funny. So lets write one.

I'll just run up my super computer

Note: The most fascinating thing about this page is that I can keep doing it and go over it and just come out with more garbage without telling people the point, that we're all flawed because we're doing each other wrong. What you need to talk about is networking, because that seems buggy.

What makes networking hard? Packet overflow.

What causes anxiety in social situations?
Seeing Pretty Girl(){
	Society(){
		rules();
		conventions();
		rigamortis();
	};
	Humanity(){
		humor();
		grace();
		freedom();
	};
};
So my only guess is that when we merge the two, we get errors because we try to equate humanity with society. We literally can't do society == humanity because it contradicts our ONLY RULE, "It is what it is." Sovereignty isn't humanity, only things humanity brings can be considdered humanity. 

Buuut.

Can we say humor = humanity? It's part of the object there... No, it's a function of humanity. So humor == humane. Because humane means "a part of humanity." A good part of humanity at that. 

So it's societies function to wrangle humanity even though part of it is good but it's only problem with humanity and it's struggle with humanity is simply freedom. That's the only function that gets in the way. So society's unconscious goal is to restrict freedom. The only way to do this humanely is with entertainment. 

SO THEN WHY THE FUCK IS SOCIETY GOING AFTER MY HUMOR?!
