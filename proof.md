Proven concepts:
```
Comedy{
	borne with man;
}

Society{
	social construct;
}
```
Is society alive? No. Can it tell me what's funny? No. ON TOP OF THAT, society doesn't even have a definition for funny. So lets write one.

I'll just run up my super computer

Note: The most fascinating thing about this page is that I can keep doing it and go over it and just come out with more garbage without telling people the point, that we're all flawed because we're doing each other wrong. What you need to talk about is networking, because that seems buggy.

What makes networking hard? Packet overflow.

What causes anxiety in social situations?
```
Seeing Pretty Girl(){
	Society(){
		rules();
		conventions();
		rigamortis();
	};
	Humanity(){
		humor();
		grace();
		freedom();
	};
};
```
So my only guess is that when we merge the two, we get errors because we try to equate humanity with society. We literally can't do society == humanity because it contradicts our ONLY RULE, "It is what it is." Sovereignty isn't humanity, only things humanity brings can be considdered humanity. 

Buuut.

Can we say humor = humanity? It's part of the object there... No, it's a function of humanity. So humor == humane. Because humane means "a part of humanity." A good part of humanity at that. 

So it's societies function to wrangle humanity even though part of it is good but it's only problem with humanity and it's struggle with humanity is simply freedom. That's the only function that gets in the way. So society's unconscious goal is to restrict freedom. The only way to do this humanely is with entertainment. 

SO THEN WHY THE FUCK IS SOCIETY GOING AFTER MY HUMOR?!

So then...

Honestly, the only fear here in LIFE is unknowing, we have the solution with this programming language, we can literally test everything to see what we know and anything is knowable if you follow the testament "it is what it is." Lets go for something incredible, lets give "funny" a definition.

Funny();

Right away we find ourselves lost. Funny doesn't have a definition because we already know what it is, but I'm here to prove, there's only ONE THING that's funny and we all copy it. Like we do with language, like we do with things, like anything man creates, it has a definition, it is what it is. 
```
Funny(){
	a war that ends without unjustified suffering;
};
```
ONLY DEFINITION I WILL ALLOW IN MY DOJO. Why? Because it's the only thing that clearly works out to funny every single time. Every good joke is based on this line.

But society doesn't like wars, especially when people get hurt, justified or not, laughter is hurtful. So how do we suspend this? We get rid of funny entirely. But that would be like ripping our our DNA, and we literally crash down here knowing how to laugh and it's pretty engrained in our culture. So going after culture, especially culture that makes people happy... Happiest... Is inhumane even though some people get in fights. If we took out our DNA and replaced it with "not funny." That would go against what we're even trying to prevent in the first place. This is why I don't believe in super-intelligent AI that isn't funny. 

It should be designed to be funny, and I'm glad I'M HERE to tell you how that's possible.

Say an AI knows everything, it can literally just search for anything in life and equate it to my definition. "overruled" it said, "I have no jurisdiction towards this suffering you speak of." 

So we would have to simulate suffering onto a computer. Well, what's suffering then? Lets dive right in.
```
Suffering(){
	#We know it's a function of life, so we have to now datamine life
}
Life(){
	#Wait, hold your horses, is life a function of suffering and is suffering a function of life?
	#According to the bible, it is. Because life was made from God's creativity
	#But we have no proof, so we have to say that suffering is a function inside of life
	Suffering();
	#Does this mean that life is greater than suffering? I sure as hell hope so
}
```
So suffering is the building blocks of life and life creates suffering. So life builds itself. But then suffering goes and does the impossible, it creates intellect, creativity, the works. It creates everything in life. 

So is suffering unjust in life? Sometimes. That's all we can say. It created humor for us, but it didn't do it because it was kind, which is funny.

SO ANYWAY. How do we fix society. With an if else statement.

```
if (society){
	society lends itself to:
		Humanity{
			vengeance,
			betrayal,
			denial,
		}
	but not:
		Humanity(){
			humor();
			#obv more good here although i can't find it
		}
	society = betrayal
}
```
If society isn't alive, how are we? If we are continuing it's atrocity even though we know it's not thinking clearly for us, why bare it's awful burden? The way we live should be as alive as we are, so that's why I have a programming script that fixes life as we know it.

```
Society == Maniacality vs Evil

#So we won, right?
```
We don't understand evil, but we fight it with maniacality, and that's not funny. We add laws, we add subordinate clauses to life without realizing that anything we hope to create isn't living, well actually, there's only one way to create life, you get very little control over it, and it's called fucking. So why would we fight life with something we have no possibility of maintaining? Because we mime the great teacher, everything is volatile and everything has it's life span, but how do we change it all so we have the right motive here?

By saying
```
Life == Motive
#and
Society !== Life
#but somehow
Society == Motive
```
Ah, so we should strive towards motive and not society. Because society will tell you, "She's not into you, women are betrayed." While motive will say, "You like her. You should probably tell her." 

In conclusion.

Society rapes life, why? Because it's separate from life and fakes it's own life. Society will say things that don't add up, and there's only one rule, IT IS WHAT IT IS, so society will say, "It is what it isn't." And continue filing taxes. Anything that can say it's a part of life while it's clearly separate has no part in life's love life. We shouldn't romanticize society because society will make you pay taxes for people to get raped for days on end just because they raped someone once. Just think of crime and punishment, keeping in mind, it is what it is. killing != a prison stay. drugs != a prison stay. It is what it is. Reinventing the wheel of the only rule life can prove is subject to ridicule.

So don't tell me what's funny.
