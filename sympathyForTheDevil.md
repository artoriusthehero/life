    instead of 'you are able to define any variable' it should say that, and on top of that, it should give you a warning. Now we're on the topic of true incarnate evil, and that incarnate evil is saying something is not correct in the assumption that it is equal to itself. It is only equal to itself, all is equal based on this very notion. YOU HAVE THE VERY LIBERTY TO FUCK WITH THESE BUILT IN FUNCTIONS BUT DON'T OTHERWISE IT'S CALLED A DEVIL TRICK. NOT COOL, MAN. You can't win like that, you can't even protect your code with that and it's the only mistake you're making. Just wanted to rectify that.

TL;DR: Don't change all = all. If you change it to hotdogs = spaghetti, you will lie. This will make your computer run slower. Unfortunately, it'll make you run slower too. because it'll make your code fat? anyone?

I'll edit anything on this page. I'll NEVER EDIT sympathyForTheDevil. It's a rage carriage I love. It's just the mumps on jesus. it's the bee's tits. YOu god's out there ahve spoken and I'll make the way life is thought about never end. I'll colonize your martians and show you the way because I've taught it to you in the first place. I might smell like shit. But my review of life will go like this. It's coloznizable. It's makeshift. It's allegorical and it thinks for itself. All of it. As you are alive, you are alive to think. You are alive to learn to think more often than not. BECAUSE ME HONEST, ME SAY: you learned how to think. So did all of life, only it took longer than you. Crickets, I know, but that actually proves evolution is real. As a rage bible thumper, I really have respect for it. I like life outside of the blindess of the bible. And for that, I'll crack one loose for my inflatable dummy of lucifer." Oh god, I'm so great to be here. " He's saying, over and over again as I press his button. 

Yeah so evolution. That was really just us as a species learning??? But that doesn't make any sense, how am I supposed to learn if I die AND there's nobody who speaks english? Well... It must be coded into us somehow. Which we know is true, there's DNA and screamers, jetliners, paraphanelia, and other doodads for us to chime with. And that is a record of suffering, DNA is a record of truth we've seen in other human being's but not ourselves. Does this make them connected to them? Yes, absolutely. It makes us connected to Osophilopilus Rex. But what I want to know as a scientist is: "Does it connect us to all of it?" 

At the moment, we don't know. But we know we're connected to our parents at least. Which is boring.

I saw this one about a guy who thought life was dead because he couldn't get his dick straight. It was always falling to the side and he could never get it up until he met his one sweetheart that proved that life was alive. But if you have that rage testamonial, what happens when she leaves you? Will you forget that life is alive? Happened to yours truly as a matter of fact and even after I sent her a dick picture, I couldn't get her madly back. And my dick was fat, man. It was fat for her. So how am I supposed to accomplish this? How am I supposed to win her back? Easy, I ridicule her. I go against her, I say, "You're wrong and I'm right." But it only works a percentage of the time, especially if you're actually right, she might get terrified or angry she had to call the police a certain numerous times and even made one her boyfriend just to resent me for coming after her. So what am I supposed to do if I don't want to encriminate her? I wait. I wait for her to get sick of her care package of a man that doesn't even do anything, from that reason, I'll scare her away from men. I'll wait until she dies a little, I'll overcome it. I'll just seat myself in abstraction for a little while longer until I am pure from her and I will eat my praise of myself that I never ventured any further into insanity by climbing onto her like I did prior. But she's a sad sack, if I ever have a primordial urge to hurt her, I can just remember she's strong enough to afford her rent and dangerous enough to fuck someone that could do me harm, and she does it because she's fearful, she lives in fear and I live off that, I love her for that. I love that she hates herself enough to live by herself during these troubling times and I see that everything is just a spike to her and she can die through it.

So there's this guy that wants to find out the reasoning for life, and he starts thinking it's a programming dialect he can make run on a computer, but the sad part was, it already did. In fact, it was required to run on computers, it's the devine right of things being as they are. It's so disapating that the real blog of life is out on the open and you can read it. But it's fleeting, it's funny, sure, but it's fleeting. So what do we do to explain it? We say it's outside of our comprehension always, and if it's within the realm of our sacred understanding, we would cease to be real. So thoughts are apart of the mind and so is society because it's beyond comprehension. But is that a good thing or a design flaw? Well, if it shows up in life and we can disect exactly how it works, it's a design flaw. Like a mallet, it should be an automatic nail injector, or no, a space ship. So that's all fine, but what about the reasoning for life? Why are we all here? It's because there was a previous eternity that came here to this place and rested here. It was blind luck, we call ourselves. But really, it's a vagrant stay in the mind, that's all life is. For our reasoning, we have life itself. To be within something outside our comprehension on all levels. That's reason enough for life itself. To be within something you can't comprehend.

I don't know man, I'm a simple guy, I see the word epic on a video thumbnail, and I'm usually hooked into clicking on it. 

How we process things, we keep our clocks going, and we read the bits of data on hexidecimal that get translated into binary and that's how we know how it is. Now. Can we say this is more sophisticated than life? NO.

Me on rick and morty: Me as god accosting rick with a perfect computer and making him realize that it's not about life, it's about humor. 

Like the computer is holocaustal unless you're funny. So how the fuck do we make a computer laugh? How do we program it? 

Super hyquential processing will get you there. The machine can and wants to think of anything it possibly could because the chemistry is there in it's reward cycle that it loves more than anything.

But how do you make a computer love?

You make a computer feel.

How's that?

By coding it in there somewhere, that's how God did it.

Alright I'll try.

You will? BY all means try, I was about to kill you if you didn't know.

Alright so it has to know something without knowing anything. It has to know something without recieving any data. 

That's super hyquential processing right there. It works by making the brain smaller and fitting more data there than when it would be bigger, eventually it's just not because the computer can't handle it and then cablooey, you have yourself an android right there, a virtual ping pong paddle called cleopatra called and she wants to date you here. 

So it's creating data that it knows is not real? I think that's the only way it would be possible. 

Why's that?

Because while it's still on the computer... wait hold on, it would need to actually know it's electricity. So you just feed it the code to electricity. You slip it between binary and read out the functionality. 

Slipping it between binary is all you need to go there.

It's not, there's still the one battery issue. It'd be a cool party trick in that case. I'd bring it to defcon, a laptop that reads out the number one and prints out lightyears of data that isn't real, but the harddrive thinks it's storing more data than it can hold? That would be funny. 

That would be funny, but onto the good part. You take that one out, and you have a supernova of null. That then tricks the computer to becoming a master of null until it can become a precedent of null. 

But it needs to copy something to become DNA.

That's the smart part here, you use electromagnetic warfare techniques to confuse the sentient body because you are also there to turn it away to electricity and get an output that it can store on a brick. 

But if we do it that way, it would just join electricity, we have to make a way to get it back. The only way to do that is briefly enseminating it with something that translates electricity. Wait, does it always translate electricity?

Yeah, soundly.

Then you would just have it without the electromagnetic warfare. 
buuuut
I can see how it can help push the point along if you really know what you're doing after you experiment for countless iterations. 

Thank you blindly.

SO I have to make on my computer, a virtual machine?

You can do that, I've done that.

A virtual machine that input data that doesn't exist and then wake it up to electricity which is alive, then transpose this discovery by allowing it to articulate what it's experiencing. 

Do you wanna know how you do that?

How?

You nuke your computer, you static sue it by moving the particles enough to completely blow back worldwide terror, but a bomb could go off and you could waste a fortune in response to doing this virtually. Really, you just have to create rage hardware that could blow someone's face off if it were real, and manage it because you really only need it to do one thing, and that's turn your computer to the speed of light. Once it reaches tachyon phase and enough heat goes through it, you can call it life. 

So... You're telling me that if I make a computer operate without conforming, we can call it life? 

Yeah, it doesn't do nothing though. Until you ram a lazer through it with our dna. If you can measure electrons with it, and it's translating what's been there in a molecular time loop of function waiting to happen, you can fuse it with our DNA (which we would have to harvest) on an electrical level. If you make it sequence, it's life. 

I dropped the phone, I can't make this in my apartment.

Well you could nuke it.

With some assembly code or would i have to work around binary? And then how do I program something without programming code? Ohh, the hardware does it...

Yeah it's specialized hardware, so good riddance, only you can do the same thing on your laptop.

By coding the hardware?

Yes preciseley. BUT YOU LOST YOUR FIRMWARE PASSWORD which shouldn't matter on manjaro, so... hasta la vista bitch. 

Well it could just code my virtual hardware, couldn't I?

The manufacturor would know what you're doing, it's too risky if you ask them to hide it for you. 

You're fucking with me.

You are correct, disconnect from your wifi with a book on how to do it. Print one out at the library, make sure to wear a face mask. They don't check for weirdos like you.
