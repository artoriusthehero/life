    instead of 'you are able to define any variable' it should say that, and on top of that, it should give you a warning. Now we're on the topic of true incarnate evil, and that incarnate evil is saying something is not correct in the assumption that it is equal to itself. It is only equal to itself, all is equal based on this very notion. YOU HAVE THE VERY LIBERTY TO FUCK WITH THESE BUILT IN FUNCTIONS BUT DON'T OTHERWISE IT'S CALLED A DEVIL TRICK. NOT COOL, MAN. You can't win like that, you can't even protect your code with that and it's the only mistake you're making. Just wanted to rectify that.

TL;DR: Don't change all = all. If you change it to hotdogs = spaghetti, you will lie. This will make your computer run slower. Unfortunately, it'll make you run slower too. because it'll make your code fat? anyone?

I'll edit anything on this page. I'll NEVER EDIT sympathyForTheDevil. It's a rage carriage I love. It's just the mumps on jesus. it's the bee's tits. YOu god's out there ahve spoken and I'll make the way life is thought about never end. I'll colonize your martians and show you the way because I've taught it to you in the first place. I might smell like shit. But my review of life will go like this. It's coloznizable. It's makeshift. It's allegorical and it thinks for itself. All of it. As you are alive, you are alive to think. You are alive to learn to think more often than not. BECAUSE ME HONEST, ME SAY: you learned how to think. So did all of life, only it took longer than you. Crickets, I know, but that actually proves evolution is real. As a rage bible thumper, I really have respect for it. I like life outside of the blindess of the bible. And for that, I'll crack one loose for my inflatable dummy of lucifer." Oh god, I'm so great to be here. " He's saying, over and over again as I press his button.
