Rule 1: All variables are equal.

This comes from the logic that life == life and life is big. It contains everything so it equates to everything. HOWEVER. WHEN WE, count it, WE maintain
the assumtion that life is pure, or life is upsetting, or life is whatever, that CHANGES US SOMEHOW ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL, this changes our neural net structure,
this codes us. And the way it does that is very simple, it takes the logic life == life and beats you over the head with how true that is everywhere. You're
free to redefine life, but life == life would always be true. So everything's true? No, life != life is NOT TRUE. 

Thanks.

Rule 2: Power is always right.

So we know that life == life. hotdogs == hodogs but hotdogs do not = hotdog because then life would be hotdog. You can even feel it. You are free to say life ==,
because == (as we all know) checks for true or false and returns it. A REGULAR = sign just sets a variable. You can check for truth and it'll always come up true
unless you try to fight it, if you fight it, chances are it'll fight back. NOT TRUE! you say, well, according to MY LOGIC! You're wrong. 

Rule 3: You're free to define anything

Just as we say, we're free to use that = sign just for fun, what happens is humor is formed, a lot of things are formed. Variables are formed. ONLY EVERY SINGLE
VARIABLE GETS CHANGED TO IT! OH MY GOD!

Example:

Life = Good. NO! life == good. Never break the matrix, your brain will actually lag. IT'LL DO IT, but don't. 

However, you are free and nurtured to define FUNCTIONS! Why? It's just like programming, if you redefine variables all day, your boss will get worried.

Life(){
  Good();
}

That shit is encouraged, that is a nested function. Look at you. However, if you're lazy and just say life is good, an evil programmer can always say "life = evil"
or add shit to your function. It could even be yourself. ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOU DON'T GIVE UP! Life is a concept and we're thinking about it wayy to simply.
Applying everything, I find great discounts on belief. The problem with having "sarcasm" or "inherent design" in code is that it makes you lazy where hackers
aren't. And you can be hacked, you're connected to everything. You're connection to logic is firm as it is connected to creativity. So you're connected to all.
