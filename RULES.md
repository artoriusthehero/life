<strong>Rule 1: All variables are equal to itself.</strong>

So yeah, this is pretty easy to prove in life. something == something comes out as true. But they have to be exactly the same, otherwise it's a lie.

Thanks.

<strong>Rule 2: Power is always right and you have to fight.</strong>

So, you're constantly beaten up by society. That's all this rule means. In your own head. Always beaten up by everything whenever you're wrong.

<strong>Rule 3: It runs off time and belief forever.</strong>

Yeah, you function of your beliefs. And this programming language is all belief, but belief only comes when we KNOW it's done right. Whenever we KNOW.

<strong>Rule 4: If you don't know, you're wrong about it</strong>

So you could have something that's like... "I don't know." Well, that came from somewhere so trace it back. Okay, "I don't know why I'm saying bad words." So we know two things. It's wrong to say bad words and you don't want to do it anymore. Now we know two things instead of knowing nothing. Whenever we don't know, we must backtrack through our code and tell ourselves what's missing. That's just programming for the history books.
