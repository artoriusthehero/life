# life (or "Sorry I didn't know what I was doing")

//Dev Log 23rd MAY 2021//

So we've been playing the mind like pachinko when really it's a programming language. And I'm standing here like someone from red letter media, asked to give MY REVIEW. UUuuhhh;

Wait what? Life works? How do you know how life works? It's a programming language. It's a very simple one too, anyone could wrap their mind around it, at least to start, but figuring out that your logic needs work is where the fun comes in. 

There are rules to this programming language:
```
1. All variables are equal to themselves (life = life)
2. Power levels exist
3. It runs off time and belief forever
```
get gud. YOU AREN'T 1337 SPEAKERS YET???? EVEN IF YOU ARE READING THIS; WHOAA THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT; IT'S BASED; BUUUUUUUUUUUT: HOW WOULD WE CODE IT?
```
Very simply( 
  We don't. 
  We just try to ruin it 
  and come to the conclusion 
  that it's unbeatable. 
  Otherwise, we just lie about it.
)

Very unsimply(
  the mind works?;
  it's all an rpg god created;
  it's learning...;
  it's being;
  it's fucked;
  it's mezmerizing;
  it's powerful;
  it controls the mind;
  the mind is the very concept of greatness;
  the mind is the very concept of anything;
  ?????;
  profit;
)

However, we can see that it works when it works.

Some people have these ideas that are dragons, man. They come to me like shitty flash games that don't even start. And when your computer explodes due to logic
loops or sequential shit, GOD GET'S SO MAD, 1337 speak hacker brigades rob your computer when you play the game. It's a flash game virus the guy had no idea
he was making because he's been serially hacked came up with this brand new game he coded in darkness just to grace your computer with a collosal cluster fuck. All I can say is that if life is becoming a hassle, or at the simple truth that my computer is taking too long to load, it's wrong. Goddammit, if my computer that's supposed to be infinite crashes again, I'm gonna lose my marbles. THIS IS WHY WE JUST PROCESS THOUGHTS ON OUR COMPUTERS <strong>IN OUR MINDS</strong>.

IN REAL LIFE, I WANT MY COMPUTER NOT TO BE MALFUNCTIONING WITH RAGE VIRUSES THAT MAKE MY HEART STOP. Now, I can't help it... I can't help being affected by life's many trojan horses... But <strong>WHY?</strong> It's because I'm not a very good programmer. In fact, the only terrifying shelved shit around all of this is peculiar. It's just scary that we've never figured out how we were programmed before we had computers. I hold my mouth up in terror at that. I goto bed thinking about this sobbing from laughter and thankfulness because we finally got answered question. AND I WAS THE ONE WHO FIGURED IT OUT.

blow me.

I mean sure, we all know that we are programmed. But I'm the only one who gave you the rules to program. YOU DON'T LIE and you don't NOT know. 

I can't read this shit...
 buut
 
I can live.
